OK, so you want to use this calculator... You do so at your own risk.
<P>
I will not be held personally responsible for your bad math habits. If
you choose to not follow the instructions and put your own numbers into the
"Total Hours" fields, and it screws up the calculations, it's your own
dang fault.
<P>
Look, I'm just a humble web developer, and frankly, I don't have the
time or the inclination to get into legal wranglings over some
lousy calculations.  If you want to use this calculator, don't quote me
on the precise results to your agency - especially rounded numbers (since they can be screwed with so easily).  In the end, we are all responsible for our own math. 
I advise you to double-check the math, here and there, every now and then, to satisfy your curiosity. I'm not proud. 
Use this little toy as an approximating tool.  Something to help you get
through your timesheet figuring early on Monday mornings.
