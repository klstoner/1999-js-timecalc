# 1999-js-timecalc
A simple JavasScript calculator I wrote in 1999 to simplify filling in timesheets for my coworkers and myself
I actually started this and began using it in 1997, when everybody was contracting and we all had different paper timesheets to fill out. We all needed a quick and easy way to just calculate the total hours, because we were filling out paper (I know!) slips that didn't do the math for us. What a pain! So, I created this simple timesheet calculator and sent it to them, and that was that.
Because it's JS, you don't need to run it on a server (obvs), so I could just email them the file(s) and that was that. Simple, right? Way simpler than the stuff we're doing now.
As you can see, if you Ctrl+U, the logic reveals the early days of JavaScript, before it was considered a "real" programming language, so I came to it from a front-end markup perspective, completely missing the opportunities of reusing code, doing things programmatically, etc.
But it worked, so that's all that mattered.
